# stat221
Problem sets and final project codes for Harvard statistics course stat221 "computational computing and learning" with Professor Edoardo Airoldi

The problem sets involve replicating results from the following papers:

Raftery (1988) - implements MCMC approrach to derive Binomial distribution parameters (N, theta)

Tebaldi & West (JASA, 1998) - implements MCMC algorithms to infer origin-destination (OD) flows from link loads in a communication network, assuming that unobserved OD flows follow Poisson distributions

Cal et al. (JASA, 2000) - implements EM algorithm to solve the same problem to infer OD flows from link loads in a communication network, but assuming unobserved OD flows follow Normal distributions

The final project examines the sensitivity of the coevolution model of network and behavior to latent homophily effects through simulations
